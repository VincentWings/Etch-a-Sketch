# Etch-a-Sketch app

https://vincentwings.github.io/Etch-a-Sketch/

Etch-a-Sketch is an app that allows you to create drawings on a canvas using your keyboard arrow keys. When you open the app, you will see a canvas element with a border and a button at the bottom.

To start drawing, simply use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the cursor around the canvas. As you move the cursor, a line will be drawn behind it, creating your drawing.

You can change the color of the lines by continuously pressing the arrow keys. The hue of the stroke color will increment with each key press, creating a rainbow effect.

If you want to clear the canvas and start a new drawing, simply click the button at the bottom of the screen. This will add a shaking animation to the canvas, indicating that it is being cleared.

That's all there is to it! Simply use the arrow keys to draw and the button to clear the canvas. Have fun creating your own Etch-a-Sketch masterpieces!
